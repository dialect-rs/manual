# DIALECT
The __DIALECT__(**DIA**batic **L**ocally **E**xcited and **C**harge-**T**ransfer states) software was designed to calculate the excited state properties and exciton dynamics of large molecular systems, including strong light-matter interactions between microcavities and molecular assemblies. It is developed in the group of Prof. Dr. Roland Mitrić at the University of Würzburg.

This short documentation provides guidelines for the installation and use of the __DIALECT__ software.
